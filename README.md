# build-assets

This repo is just a technical holding ground for some binary assets we want to refer to in our
github pipelines by stable github hosted URLs but don't want in a website or code repo, and which
aren't secrets.

Rules of the road

1. A directory per asset
2. The directory should contain a file (perhaps ASSET.md) with provenance and description
3. Don't delete stuff here without asking the person who last committed the asset
